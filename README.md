###  Biography

I received the **B.S. degree** in mechanical engineering and automation from **Hohai University** in 2015, and the **Ph.D. degree** in control science and engineering from the Institute of Robotics and Automatic Information System, **Nankai University** in 2020, supervised by [Prof. Xuebo Zhang](https://ai.nankai.edu.cn/info/1033/3984.htm). My research interest includes **localization** and **mapping** for **mobile robots**.

From July 2020 to July 2021, I worked as a **Senior Algorithm Engineer** in **IAS BU** (Huawei Intelligent Automotive Solution), with research interests include **freespace extraction**, **APA**(Auto Parking Asist) and **AVP**(Automated Valet Parking). I am currently a Research Fellow with **Zhejiang Lab**, and my research interests include **localization** and **perception** for **intelligent vehicles** and **mobile robots**.
